## Version Changelogs

<summary>Version 0.0.1:</summary>
<p>

Created the project and made this git repository. 

Created the base structure and some base files I want to use for the game in the form of a MVC pattern. The files are separated into different packages named accordingly. The plan is to have one "main" View/Controller/Model file that uses the other files within their respective packages to make the program work as intended.
