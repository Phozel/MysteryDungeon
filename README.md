## Version Changelogs

<details>
<summary>Version 0.0.2:</summary>
<p>

Added the Pokemon Sprites and Portraits as mentioned in the to-do list and made it possible to draw any of them in the game window. Also added the temporary functionality of making the sprite resize to fit the window better so it is more visible given the initial small size of the image.

<summary>Version 0.0.1:</summary>
<p>

Created the project and made this git repository. 

Created the base structure and some base files I want to use for the game in the form of a MVC pattern. The files are separated into different packages named accordingly. The plan is to have one "main" View/Controller/Model file that uses the other files within their respective packages to make the program work as intended.
